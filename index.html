	Set during the reign of King Sukjong in the Joseon dynasty, the series is based on real-life historical figure Choi Suk-bin. Dong-yi is an orphaned slave maid working in the Bureau of Music. Her warm personality, sincerity and exceptionally keen mind help her in solving difficult court intrigues. While solving a case, she meets the king who introduces himself as a court judge. He enjoys her treatment of him as an ordinary person, and falls in love with her. She also gains the favor of Queen Inhyeon and becomes her trusted confidante, then meets Jang Hui-bin, a concubine who is first her ally but later a bitter enemy. In her quest to survive in court and bring justice to lowborn commoners like herself, she makes many allies such as her devoted protector Cha Chun-soo (whom she considers an older brother despite not being blood-related), the police chief Seo Young-gi, and the court ladies Jung and Bong. Dong-yi becomes a royal concubine with the rank of Suk-bin, then bears a son who, under her tutelage, later becomes the 21st king of Joseon, Yeongjo, the father of Crown Prince Sado and grandfather of Yi San.
